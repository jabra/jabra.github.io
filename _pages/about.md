Gabriel Zaccak is a seasoned computer scientist with a rich background in leading teams and implementing scalable AI technologies. His professional journey began with creating distributed services for major broadcasting networks like NPR, XM, FranceTV, ABC, and CBC, enhancing their ability to collaborate across various locations.

Gabriel's foray into AI was catalyzed during his graduate studies at MIT CSAIL. Here, he immersed himself in the creation of innovative interactive tools leveraging natural language for seamless information access. His projects at the lab encompassed automated lecture processing, Q&A systems, and software agents. Additionally, his internship at Google offered him a firsthand glimpse into machine learning at a grand scale.

Gabriel has also successfully exited two startups: one in EdTech, where he created a training and assessment platform that has been integrated into Elsevier's Sherpath, a premier nursing education platform; and at doc.ai (acquired by Sharecare), where he spearheaded the machine learning platform and solutions teams. His leadership involved adeptly navigating the intricacies of the healthcare sector to develop models for big data, catering to 100 million members, and advancing edge computing and private machine learning, ultimately leading to securing a $100 million contract from Anthem BCBS.

Gabriel, after his time at Sharecare, has provided strategic AI consulting to both large firms and startups. Now, as the founder of Vivify, he is launching a platform designed to transform creative education. Vivify connects creators and experts, helping 2D art teachers scale their work without burnout by using AI-powered tools. These tools boost student success by over 90%, increase teacher income by 10x, and create a seamless learning experience that continues even after live sessions.
