Gabriel Zaccak is a seasoned computer scientist with a rich background in leading teams and implementing scalable AI technologies. His professional journey began with creating distributed services for major broadcasting networks like NPR, XM, FranceTV, ABC, and CBC, enhancing their ability to collaborate across various locations.

Gabriel's foray into AI was catalyzed during his graduate studies at MIT CSAIL. Here, he immersed himself in the creation of innovative interactive tools leveraging natural language for seamless information access. His projects at the lab encompassed automated lecture processing, Q&A systems, and software agents. Additionally, his internship at Google offered him a firsthand glimpse into machine learning at a grand scale.

Gabriel has also successfully exited two startups: one in EdTech, where he created a training and assessment platform that has been integrated into Elsevier's Sherpath, a premier nursing education platform; and at doc.ai (acquired by Sharecare), where he spearheaded the machine learning platform and solutions teams. His leadership involved adeptly navigating the intricacies of the healthcare sector to develop models for big data, catering to 100 million members, and advancing edge computing and private machine learning, ultimately leading to securing a $100 million contract from Anthem BCBS.

Gabriel, after his time at Sharecare, has provided strategic AI consulting to both large firms and startups. Now, as the founder of Vivify, he is launching a platform designed to transform creative education. Vivify connects creators and experts, helping 2D art teachers scale their work without burnout by using AI-powered tools. These tools boost student success by over 90%, increase teacher income by 10x, and create a seamless learning experience that continues even after live sessions.

<!-- Post Sharecare, Gabriel has been a strategic consultant for both large firms and startups, providing hands-on AI expertise. Currently, he is embarking on an exciting new venture, founding his startup, with more details to be revealed soon! -->



<!-- Hi, I'm Gabriel, a computer scientist with research and industry experience leading multiple teams and deploying scalable AI solutions. I started my career developing distributed services for broadcasting networks like NPR, XM, FranceTV, ABC and CBC.

My journey in AI began as a graduate student at MIT CSAIL, where I was deeply involved in developing intelligent interactive tools that enable people to access information through natural language. The lab became my playground where I worked on automated lecture processing, Q&A systems, and software agents. I also interned at Google and this is where I experienced ML at scale.

Over the past eight years in startups, I transitioned from individual contributor to leadership positions, including two successful exits and an IPO experience. Most recently, I served as SVP of AI, leading a center of excellence that developed internal ML platforms and AI solutions for internal and external customers in the complex healthcare industry.

Gabriel has successfully exited two startups: one in EdTech, where he created a training and assessment platform that has been integrated into Elsevier's Sherpath, a premier nursing education platform; and at doc.ai, where he spearheaded the machine learning platform and solutions teams. His leadership involved adeptly navigating the intricacies of the healthcare sector to develop models for big data, catering to 100 million members, and advancing edge computing and private machine learning, ultimately leading to securing a $100 million contract from Anthem.

Before that, I led engineering at Authess, an edtech startup acquired by Elsevier. We used deep learning to automate grading for open-ended assessments, improving efficiency, accuracy, and enabling personalized interventions.

Since leaving Sharecare, I've been consulting on strategy and hands-on AI projects.

I'm now taking the plunge and building my own startup from scratch - more details coming soon!

<!-- Hi, My name is Gabriel and I am computer scientist with research and industry experience leading mutliple teams and deploying  scalable AI solutions.

I started my career in the broadcasting industry distributed services (before cloud days) for TV and Radio stations networks across the world (NPR, XM, FranceTV, ABC)

My journey in AI started as a grad student at MIT CSAIL, where I was deeply involved in the development of intelligent interactive tools that help people access information on the web through natural language. I worked on automated lecture processing, Q&A systems and Agents for the Web to perform tasks.

Over the past eight years, I've been working in the startup world, transitioning from individual contributor roles to leadership positions. My journey includes two successful exits and an experience with going public. I recently held the position of SVP of AI, where my department served as the center of excellence throughout the company. My team was also responsible for developing our internal ML platform, where we develop and serve our solutions at scale for both internal and external customers, all while navigating the nuanced challenges presented by the heavily-regulated healthcare sector.

Before Sharecare, I led engineering at an Authess, Ed tech startup (acquired by elsevier).
I developed and deployed an open-ended assessment platform. We used deep learning algorithms to automate the grading process, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy and helping educators to assess and intervene in personalized manner.

I was lucky to also intern at Google twice during grad school, and get inspired and absorb what does it mean to be a true AI company.

Since my departure from Sharecare, I'v been involved in multiple consulting opportunities involving strategy and being hands on.

Currently, I'm taking the plunge and starting my own startup from the ground up. More to come soon. -->
